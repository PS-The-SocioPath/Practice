# Practice

Self Project

Python | Data Science | Machine Learning | Natural Language Processing 

The project aims to develop an ML model for sentiment analysis to classify text data into categories (eg: positive/negative/neutral). Using statistical techniques by leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib. This is done in 1_Python_Basics

First, I will preprocess and analyze the dataset to extract meaningful features. Then, I will apply various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Clustering, etc to train and evaluate the model's performance on various parameters. This is being done in 2_ML_Models, which will soon be uploaded.

The final model will provide insights into the general sentiment of text-based datasets, which could be applied in fields like customer feedback analysis, customer segmentation, disease prediction or social media monitoring etc. 

NLP and the remaining part of the project will also soon be added.
