The project aims to develop an ML model for sentiment analysis to classify text data into categories (eg: positive/negative/neutral). Using statistical techniques by leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

First, I will preprocess and analyze the dataset to extract meaningful features. Then, I will apply various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Clustering, etc to train and evaluate the model's performance on various parameters. 

The final model will provide insights into the general sentiment of text-based datasets, which could be applied in fields like customer feedback analysis, customer segmentation, disease prediction or social media monitoring etc.
